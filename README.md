The identification of space groups from XRD data is a critical yet time-consuming process in
 materials science, typically requiring human intervention. To address this challenge, we explore the
 application of machine learning techniques to automate the classification process. This project uses
 a large dataset of 50,000 XRD data points from the Materials Project database to improve the speed
 and accuracy of identifying space groups. The results demonstrate the potential of neural networks
 to effectively classify XRD patterns.
